ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @penfle. I'm from Seattle, Washington and I use she/her pronouns.

ðŸ‘€ I love mathematics, and I wish to study applied statistics in the future. In my free time, I'm probably hacking into boxes on https://tryhackme.com!

ðŸ“« I'm open for any contact, collaboration requests, or questions! You can email me at penelopefleury6@gmail.com OR wheresbrick988 on Discord :D
